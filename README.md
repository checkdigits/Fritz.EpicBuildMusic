# Fritz.EpicBuildMusic
Play epic music while your Visual Studio build process runs.

I'm writing this Visual Studio 2017 extension live on my [Twitch stream](https://twitch.tv/csharpfritz).  

You can now [download a pre-release version](https://github.com/csharpfritz/Fritz.EpicBuildMusic/releases) that plays music during the build process.

Some ideas shared in the chat room that are added as issues here include:

*  Build successful completion music
*  Build failed music / sound fx
*  Build successful overlay for Visual Studio, perhaps even fireworks
*  Trigger a webhook with the completion status in order to trigger "real world" indicators: lights, etc
